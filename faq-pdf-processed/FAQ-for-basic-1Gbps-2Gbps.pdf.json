We recommend you \npractise  these tips to improve the speed via wireless connectivity:  \n \n(a) HEAT – Place your wireless router away from areas with high \ntemperature as heat will affect the router performance and browsing \nexperience.  \na. Wireless router should be placed in an open area to allow heat \nventilation.  \nb. Place the broadband equipment next to e ach other instead of \nstacking it up to reduce the risk of overheating.  \n \n(b) DISTANCE – Wireless router has distance limitations when it comes to \nsignal range. As distance increases, the signal becomes weaker.  \na. Consider placing your Wireless router in an area wh ere you would \nfrequently do your browsing activities.  \n \n(c) OBSTRUCTION – Wi-Fi signal efficiency will decrease when it passes \nthrough physical obstruction e.g.: thick walls, metals and solid objects.  \na. Consider placing your Wireless router in an open area to maximise \nsignal reception . \nb. Avoid placing your router in a closed cabinet, secluded room or \nunder the stairs.  \n \n(d) ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE – Signal waves generated by home \nappliances such as microwave ovens, refrigerators, baby monitors can \ninterfere with  your Wi -Fi connectivity.  \na.
